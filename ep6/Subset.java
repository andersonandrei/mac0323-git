/* Client. 
 * Write a client program Subset.java that takes a command-line integer k; 
 * reads in a sequence of strings from standard input using StdIn.readString(); 
 * and prints out exactly k of them, uniformly at random. 
 * Each item from the sequence can be printed out at most once.
 * 
 * Performance requirements:  
 * The running time of Subset must be linear in the size of the input. 
 * You may use only a constant amount of memory plus either one Deque or RandomizedQueue 
 * object of maximum size at most N. (For an extra challenge, limit the maximum size to k.)
